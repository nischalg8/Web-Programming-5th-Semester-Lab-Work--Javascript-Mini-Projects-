        <p>
            DocuAgent is an AI-based system designed to extract structured
            information such as text, tables, and charts from scanned and
            digital PDF documents. The system uses OCR techniques along with
            language models to convert unstructured documents into meaningful
            JSON data.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project improved document processing efficiency and achieved
            high accuracy in character recognition and table extraction.

        <p>
            e-Samadhan is a web-based complaint management system developed for
            municipalities. It allows citizens to submit complaints online and

            issues efficiently.
        </p>

        <h3>AVL Tree Visualizer</h3>
        <p>
            This project is an educational web application that visually
            demonstrates insertion and deletion operations in an AVL tree.
            It helps students understand how self-balancing binary search
            trees maintain height balance.
        </p>
        <p>
            The visual representation makes learning data structures more
            interactive and intuitive.
